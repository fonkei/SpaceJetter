Hi, I hope you find these presets useful!!


To install them, navigate to the VST's folder as shown below and copy/paste the presets folder into there.

e.g. Program Files>Image-Line>FL Studio 9>Data>Patches>Plugin presets>Generators>toxic biohazard


its long-winded but once it's done, it's done ;-)

Have Fun.
